This study empirically characterized and compared Google's and Bing's ranking environments, analyzing technical performance (Lighthouse scores) and content attributes (lexical/semantic features) within a homogeneous commercial discount domain. Using \num{14465} SERP (Search Engine Results Page) items from 500 queries and 12 features, K-Means clustering identified six distinct web resource profiles, significantly associated with ranking tiers in both systems. Content-related attributes demonstrated a stronger aggregate association with visibility than technical scores for both Google (70.1\% importance) and Bing (61.8\%). Comparative analysis showed Bing's top-ranking results generally featured higher median values across numerous technical/content metrics than Google's. Notably for Google, high title-query semantic similarity unexpectedly associated with worse ranking odds in multivariate models, contrasting with positive main content-query similarity effects. Bing, conversely, prioritized content volume (word count) and explicit keyword signals more. These findings highlight system-specific nuances in factor weighting, contributing to IR system understanding and offering practical optimization insights. The dataset and analysis code will be made available upon publication.
